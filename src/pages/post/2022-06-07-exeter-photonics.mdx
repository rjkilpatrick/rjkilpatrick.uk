I have been elected president of the Exeter Photonics society, a student run collective focusing on outreach, industry connections, and socializing.

## Logo

I designed a new logo for the society.

We use Baron as the typeface.

## Stash

I designed some t-shirts for the society also.

## Outreach

### Dartmoor Stargazing

I helped organize a trip to Dartmoor national park, 25 February 2022 for around 60 people.
I was in charge of designing the social media promotions, and ticket sales.

### IoP Festival of Physics

I helped run a stall where we explained scientific demos to middle school aged children.
We had two tables in the Exeter Forum.

### Pint of Science

We helped out with the local branch of the national [pint of science](https://pintofscience.co.uk/) event.
We brought a number of demos along.
I was using a very diluted milk solution in a glass bottle with a bright white torch at the bottom to demonstrate why the sky looks blue during the day, then red at sunrise/sunset.

## Industry visits

### Torbay Hi-Tech cluster

I presented a poster, and organized a work trip to [Torbay Hi-Tech Cluster](https://epic-centre.co.uk/hi-tech-cluster/)'s Research and Innovation Conference.

### Effect Photonics

On 16th June 2022, I organized a tour of the facilities at [Effect Photonics](https://effectphotonics.com/), a telecoms company with a focus on photonics.
We toured both the Brixham assembly facilities and the Paignton testing campus.
