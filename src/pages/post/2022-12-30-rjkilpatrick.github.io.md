## What was wrong with the old one?

If you scroll back through the git commits of this website (don't judge the commit messages...), you'll see that this used to be a Jekyll blog with increasing amounts of customization.

Jekyll wasn't cutting the mustard for me, so I looked in search for greener pastures.

I also wanted the ability to convey scientific information easily with ease for a planned blog series with the intention of improving my writing before I have to write my thesis.

## The Shiny New One

Whilst it isn't particularly shiny, it's better in a lot of ways.

I also learned CSS grid.
Before this, I had just been using `flexbox` for everything because it was easy, but you'll notice a few grids on this site if for no other reason that for me to practice using them.
