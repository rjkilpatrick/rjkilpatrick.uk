# A Little About Me

Hello there, I'm John Kilpatrick!
I'm a Physics PhD student and amatuer software developer, based in Exeter, ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§.
I'm looking into how we can use a [fancy mirror array](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_micromirror_device) that you might find inside a computer projector to turn things from translucent into transparent.

I graduated from the University of Exeter in 2020 with a master's degree in Physics with study in New Zealand.

When I'm  you can find me hiking and camping in the beautiful Dartmoor countryside or chatting with friends over a cup of coffee.
I love being close to nature and discovering new places.

I'm also passionate about science outreach and connecting with others, so feel free to reach out and say hi!
I hope you find something interesting or useful here.
Feel free to [get in touch](/contact) if you have any questions or feedback.
