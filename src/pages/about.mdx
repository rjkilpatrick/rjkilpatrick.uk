# A Little About Me

Hello there, I'm John Kilpatrick!
I'm a Physics PhD student and amatuer software developer, based in Exeter, ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§.
I'm looking into how we can use a [fancy mirror array](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_micromirror_device) that you might find inside a computer projector to turn things from translucent into transparent.

I am currently president of [Exeter Photonics](//twitter.com/exeterphotonics), which runs some outreach activities.

I graduated from the University of Exeter in 2020 with a master's degree in Physics with study in New Zealand.

Things I'm excited about at the moment:

- Building performant and accessible websites
- Cross-platform design systems
- Great developer experience without sacrificing user experience
- Hackathons that are inclusive and don't burn you out

When I'm not staring at my computer, I like to get outside for a walk or bike ride.
Whilst I am not particularly strong, I also enjoy olympic-style weightlifting.
