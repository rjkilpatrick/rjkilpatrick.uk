Hi! I'm John Kilpatrick, a Ph.D. student in structured light group at the [University of Exeter, UK](https://exeter.ac.uk).
My main research focus is using wavefront shaping to image through multimode optical fibres, supervised by [Prof. Dave Phillips](https://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/staff/dp413) and [Prof. Nick Stone](https://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/staff/ns329).

Prior to my Ph.D., I received my master's degree in Physics with Study in New Zealand from the University of Exeter in the UK in 2020.
My master's project, supervised by Prof. Nick Stone, focused on fluorescence suppression for deep Raman measurements.
