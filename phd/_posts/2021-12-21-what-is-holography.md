## Holograms

Holograms in the media are mystic sci-fi devices, such as in Star Wars.

Holograms are real things that we can create and use, but there's a bit of a misconception about what they actually are.

A hologram is a capture of an entire light field.
This definition doesn't make a huge amount of sens by itself, but let's think about this in terms of looking through a window.

When you see a scene through a window, you see it in '3D' because each of your eyes see a slightly different picture and that's how we perceive depth.
Try holding at your index finger near your face and look at it with one eye closed and then the other, what you see with each eye is different because they're at different spatial positions.
Also, if you move your head around relative to the window, what you see changes.
This is why things on a computer display look 'flat' because they are missing this angular change of position.

The only way we perceive the light from the other side of the window is the light that travels through it.
If we assume that our scene is stationary, what if instead of having the scene behind the window, we capture a snapshot of the light in time and remove the scene, but reproduce the original light?
From the viewer's perspective, you wouldn't know that this had happened, since you would still be seeing the same light.
Whilst initially this sounds like a bad magic trick, it turns out we can actually do this by measuring the light coming from the window, then reproducing it exactly where the window was.

You might be thinking that to capture you can use a camera, and you'd be right.
Taking a picture, does take a representation of the light field on the camera centre.

This misses out on some information, however.
If you look at a picture on a computer screen or printed out, you'll see that if you move your head, so you're looking at a picture, the picture still stays from the same camera perspective, and looks almost 'flat'.

A Hologram is a recording of the entire light field with this missing _angular_ information about the light in question.
Since light moves very quickly, we can't actually measure this directly (okay, you can for microwaves, but you can't see those), like we can for sound waves (you can imagine an array of microphones if that helps).
We can only measure its average field over time, so we have to use a special trick.

## Measuring a Hologram

The process of measuring a hologram is called holography.
The way we do this is by using light of a single colour, like with a LASER and.

We call this phase-stepping holography, because we are 'stepping' through.
