I've decided to make a third person shooter, with the feel of Star Wars: Battlefront (2004), using the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/) and LEGO-style models from the [LDraw parts library](https://www.ldraw.org/).
The project is licensed under the MIT license on [GitHub](https://github.com/rjkilpatrick/BrickFPS).

## Godot

Godot is a free game engine designed with development speed in mind and its unique node-tree system means that developing modular games is easy.

The documentation for the engine is good, but not excellent.
I have still found myself reaching for the source code, even in this incredibly basic game.
This should be rectified soon however, as the team has recently [hired someone specifically for this](https://godotengine.org/article/we-hired-gdquest-work-manual).


## Moving to LDraw

Originally, the project used
LDraw parts aren't the only LEGO-like assets possible

## Collision shapes

Godot's physics engine (Bullet, unless you've changed it), has a problem with collision shapes, which I found out about [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSNe91lMe_Q).
Essentially, for a generic 3D character

## Animating the rig

This is currently the bottle-neck for the project.
In preliminary testing it was decided that non-deforming models would not be able to hold weapons properly, nor fire them in a convicing way without impacting on gameplay.
I have very limited knowledge about animating, and am struggling with taking the low-poly models from LDraw, cleaning and retopologising for animation.
I experimented with bendy bones, and whilst they worked slightly better I couldn't work out how to mirror the weights across the symmetry of the model.

## The mixamo problem

Mixamo provides pre-designed animations:

Whilst these are very aesthetic and look very plausible, the model still contains poor geometry, and any walk animation does not fit the art style of the model itself.

## Summary

This project is on the back-burner until the release of Godot 4.0
